## Overview

Simple script to automatically download, install and run macOS 10.15 Catalina (and other versions) in VirtualBox on macOS. Since VirtualBox does not support booting from APFS volumes, this script is copying the APFS EFI drivers automatically.

## FAQ

* Graphic Issues
  * Q: Applications such as Apple Maps do not work as expected.
  * A: There is currently no 3D acceleration, therefore some applications do not work.
* Recovery
  * Q: How do I start the recovery mode?
  * A: Start VM as usual and press ```CMD+C``` then you see ```Trying to find a bootable device...``` then type ```fs4:``` then ```cd TAB``` then ```./boot.efi``` (note that using ```fs4``` might be a different one in your case).
* Installation Loop
  * Q: After starting the installation the VM restarts and I see the installer again.
  * A: You've to press enter in the terminal after the installer restarts.
* Error Message
  * Q: I get the error code 2, 3, 4, or 6.
  * A: You need to have some software components installed on your machine (VirtualBox, VirtualBox Extension Pack, awk). If you've installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the script will partly install these automatically. Otherwise, you need to install them manually.
* Reboot
  * Q: I see the message ```MACH Reboot```. What should I do?
  * A: The VM failed to restart. Restart manually. However, this should not happen anymore with the latest version.
* Kernel Panic
  * Q: I see the message ```Error loading kernel cache (0x9)```. What should I do?
  * A: This error is shown from time to time. Restart the VM. However, this should not happen anymore with the latest version.
* Black Screen
  * Q: When I then boot I don't see anything, just a black screen. What should I do?
  * A: Change the VM version in the settings from ```Mac OS X (64-bit)``` to ```macOS 10.13 High Sierra (64-bit)```
* Other Issue
  * Q: Something is not working. What should I do?
